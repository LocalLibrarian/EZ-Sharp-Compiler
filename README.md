# EZ-Sharp-Compiler
## Description
This was a school project for the course CP471 - Introduction to Compiling at Wilfrid Laurier University.
## Requirements
You should only need Python 3 installed to actually run everything.
## How to Use
In order to properly run each file, you will need a code file with the file type ".cp" in the same directory as all the other files. One has been included in this repo for testing. You will also need the table.csv file in the same directory as well. Beyond that, just run each file in a terminal as you would any other Python file and give it the input it requests.
## Future Improvements
There is not likely to be any improvements made once the project is complete since it was a 4-month-long school project.
